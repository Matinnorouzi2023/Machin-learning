# Breast Cancer Classification

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. The goal is to accurately identify tumors based on their features, aiding in medical diagnosis and treatment planning.

## Key Features
- **Data Handling**: Python was used for data preprocessing, manipulation, and analysis. Libraries like pandas and numpy facilitated these tasks.
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib was employed to visualize the dataset's characteristics, feature distributions, and model performance metrics.
- **Machine Learning Pipeline**:
  - Data preprocessing involved splitting the dataset into training and testing sets and scaling features using MinMaxScaler.
  - Implemented seven classification algorithms including Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for tumor classification.
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall were computed for each model, providing insights into their effectiveness in breast cancer classification.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Keras
- **Development Tools**: Jupyter Notebook
